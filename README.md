A smart house features a set of sensors that may be used to record the behavior of a person living in the house. The historical log of the personâ€™s activity is stored as tuples (startTime, endTime, activityLabel), where startTime and endTime represent the date and time when each activity has started and ended while the activity label represents the type of activity performed by the person: Leaving, Toileting, Showering, Sleeping, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Spare_Time/TV, Grooming. The attached log file Activities.txt contains a set of activity records over a certain period of time. Define a class MonitoredData having startTime, endTime and activityLabel as instance variables and read the input file data into the data structure monitoredData of type List. Using stream processing techniques and lambda expressions introduced by Java 8, write the following set of short programs for processing the monitoredData.

1.	Count the distinct days that appear in the monitoring data.

2.	Determine a map of type that maps to each distinct action type the number of occurrences in the log. Write the resulting map into a text file.

3.	Generates a data structure of type Map> that contains the activity count for each day of the log (task number 2 applied for each day of the log) and writes the result in a text file.

4.	Determine a data structure of the form Map that maps for each activity the total duration computed over the monitoring period. Filter the activities with total duration larger than 10 hours. Write the result in a text file.

5.	Filter the activities that have 90% of the monitoring samples with duration less than 5 minutes, collect the results in a List containing only the distinct activity names and write the result in a text file.
